# Wi-Fi-Controlled-Mobile-Robot-
A mecanum robot with manual and autonomous control. DC motors are driven via H-bridge drivers with Hall-encoder feedback. An ESP32-S3 performs real-time PID + feed-forward wheel-speed control. A browser UI over Wi-Fi AP enables teleoperation. ToF sensors support obstacle avoidance and path tracking, forming a full mechatronic control stack.
